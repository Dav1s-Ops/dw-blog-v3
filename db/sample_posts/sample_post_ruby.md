# Ruby: The Elegant Programming Language

Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, it emphasizes natural syntax and readability. Let’s dive into what makes Ruby special!

## Why Choose Ruby?

> **Ruby is optimized for developer happiness.**  
> Its design principles make coding intuitive and enjoyable.

### Key Features of Ruby

1. **Elegant Syntax**: Readable and concise, Ruby code is often described as "beautiful."
2. **Object-Oriented**: Everything in Ruby is an object, making it consistent and powerful.
3. **Flexible and Dynamic**: Modify classes, methods, or even core behavior.
4. **Vibrant Ecosystem**: Frameworks like Ruby on Rails revolutionize web development.

## Ruby Syntax Showcase

### Hello, World!

Ruby keeps it simple:

```ruby
puts "Hello, world!"
```

---

### Variables and Data Types

Ruby supports dynamic typing:

```ruby
# Strings
greeting = "Hello, Ruby!"

# Numbers
age = 30

# Arrays
languages = ["Ruby", "Python", "JavaScript"]

# Hashes (Dictionaries)
frameworks = { ruby: "Rails", javascript: "React" }
```

---

### Methods and Blocks

Define a method with ease:

```ruby
# Simple Method
def greet(name)
  "Hello, #{name}!"
end

puts greet("Developer") # => "Hello, Developer!"
```

Ruby embraces blocks for iteration:

```ruby
# Using .each with a block
languages.each do |language|
  puts "I love #{language}!"
end
```

---

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Ruby's OOP makes coding intuitive:

```ruby
# Define a class
class Developer
  attr_accessor :name, :language

  def initialize(name, language)
    @name = name
    @language = language
  end

  def introduce
    "Hi, I'm #{@name}, and I code in #{@language}."
  end
end

# Create an instance
dev = Developer.new("Alice", "Ruby")
puts dev.introduce # => "Hi, I'm Alice, and I code in Ruby."
```

---

## Gems: Ruby’s Secret Sauce

Gems are libraries that extend Ruby's functionality. Use `Bundler` to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Install a gem
gem install nokogiri

# Add it to your Gemfile
gem "nokogiri"

# Install dependencies
bundle install
```

### Example: Using `Nokogiri` for Web Scraping

```ruby
require "nokogiri"
require "open-uri"

# Fetch and parse HTML
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(URI.open("https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"))

# Extract and print headlines
doc.css("h1").each do |headline|
  puts headline.text
end
```

## Ruby Philosophy

Ruby follows the principle of **least astonishment** (POLA): the language should behave in a way that minimizes surprises.

> "Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like the human body."  
> — Yukihiro Matsumoto
