## Why Markdown?

> **Markdown is the duct tape of the internet.**  
> It's flexible, easy to write, and universally supported.

Markdown allows you to focus on **content** rather than formatting. Whether you're jotting down notes, drafting a blog post, or writing documentation, Markdown is your friend.

### Key Benefits

1. **Readable Syntax**: Even raw Markdown is easy to understand.
2. **Cross-Platform**: Supported across many platforms and tools.
3. **Customizable**: Extensions like GitHub Flavored Markdown add extra features.
4. **Widely Adopted**: From README files to blogs, Markdown is everywhere.

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

Markdown supports inline `code` and block code:

```javascript
// Example of JavaScript code
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Markdown"));
```

```ruby
# Example of Ruby code
class Markdown
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def greet
    "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end
end

markdown = Markdown.new("Developer")
puts markdown.greet
```

## Blockquotes

> Markdown simplifies formatting for quotes and references.  
> "It's not about the syntax, it's about the **ideas**." — _Anonymous_
